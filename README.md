## What is MySQL

MySQL is a relational database management system, open-source, free, is ideal for both small and large applications.
MySQL is very fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use, is cross-platform, and is compliant with the ANSI SQL standard.
MySQL was first released in 1995 and is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation.

*I learned using MySQL almost 2 decades ago while building a tool to make my thesis project "EcoLodgical" interactive!*
